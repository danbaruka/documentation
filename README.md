published at <https://docs.safrochain.com>.

## What's in here

| Section | Path | Audience |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduction | `docs/intro.md`, `docs/getting-started/` | first-time visitors |
| Networks | `docs/networks/` | mainnet & testnet endpoints, chain registry |
| Run a node | `docs/run-a-node/` | node operators |
| Validators | `docs/validators/` | staking validators (incl. monitoring/Grafana, alerting, security, DR) |
| IBC & Relayers | `docs/ibc/` | relayer operators, IBC integrators |
| Developers | `docs/cli/`, `docs/modules/` | dApp developers |
| About | `docs/protocol/`, `docs/resources/` | tokenomics, governance, foundation, FAQ |

The homepage and reusable React components live in `src/`. SEO defaults
and route-level JSON-LD are in `docusaurus.config.ts` and
`src/clientModules/seo-jsonld.ts`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Safrochain-Org/docs.git safrochain-docs
cd safrochain-docs
npm install
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. Hot-reload is on by default — saving
a markdown file refreshes the browser.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | ≥ 20 (LTS) | use `.nvmrc` with `nvm use` |
| npm | ≥ 10 | bundled with modern Node |
| git | any recent | for branching and PRs |

> Yarn / pnpm work too; the lockfile committed here is `package-lock.json`.

## Writing docs

1. **Create the file** under the right section in `docs/`. File name
   becomes the URL slug (e.g. `validators/monitoring.md` →
   `/validators/monitoring`).
2. **Add frontmatter**:

   ```md
   ---
   title: Page title that appears as <h1> and <title>
   description: Two-sentence summary used in search results and social cards.
   sidebar_position: 5
   keywords:
     - keyword 1
     - keyword 2
   ---
   ```

   If `description` contains a colon, **wrap it in double quotes** so
   YAML parses correctly.

3. **Wire it into the sidebar** in `sidebars.ts`. Pages without a
   sidebar entry are not discoverable from the navigation tree.
4. **Build locally** before pushing:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The build runs in strict mode — broken links and broken anchors
   fail the build.

### Style conventions

- Title case for `title`, sentence case for headings inside the page.
- Tabs are 2 spaces; markdown lists use `-`.
- Use ` ``` ` fenced code blocks with a language tag (`bash`, `toml`,
  `yaml`, `json`, `go`, `rust`, `text` for plain output).
- For copy-pasteable command blocks, prefer `bash` and avoid leading `$`.
- Em dashes (`—`) are intentionally avoided — use `:`, `,`, or `;`
  depending on context.
- Cross-reference internal pages with **relative paths** without `.md`,
  e.g. `[Slashing & jail](./slashing)`.
- For architecture diagrams, prefer Mermaid (`mermaid` code block) over
  ASCII when the layout is non-trivial.

### SEO checklist for every page

- [ ] `title` and `description` set in frontmatter
- [ ] `keywords` includes 4–10 relevant terms
- [ ] First paragraph is a self-contained answer to "what is this page?"
- [ ] At least one `<h2>` per major section
- [ ] All external links use `https://`
- [ ] No raw URLs in prose; use `[text](url)`

## Available scripts

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Run dev server with hot reload at `http://localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Produce a production build into `build/` (used by deploy) |
| `npm run serve` | Serve the built `build/` directory locally |
| `npm run clear` | Clear Docusaurus cache (`.docusaurus/`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` over the TypeScript sources |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint over `src/` and config |
| `npm run deploy` | Local: same checks as CI (typecheck, lint, build). Live site updates by **pushing to `main`** (GitHub Pages). |

## Deployment

First-time **GitHub Pages** + Actions setup: [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md).
You must set **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** once.

### Auto deploy (GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages)

On every **push to `main`**, **CI and Deploy** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. `npm ci` → `typecheck` → `lint` → `npm run build`
2. **Upload Pages artifact** from the `build/` folder
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (no Vercel; no extra repository secrets)

**Manual re-deploy:** Actions → **CI and Deploy** → **Run workflow** on `main`.

### Local (no upload)

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This only verifies the project builds like CI. Pushing to `main` updates the public site.
