A **validator** is the operator of a CometBFT consensus node that proposes and
signs blocks for Safrochain. In return for keeping the chain live, validators
earn block rewards and a configurable commission on stake delegated to them.
This section covers the entire validator lifecycle, from first setup through
day-2 operations to graceful exit.

## What a validator actually does

| Responsibility | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Run a synced full node | You cannot sign blocks you have not seen |
| Hold and protect a **consensus key** | Used to sign every block; loss or duplication causes slashing |
| Hold and protect an **operator key** | Used to send `tx staking edit-validator`, `unjail`, withdraw rewards |
| Stay online (target ≥ 99.9 %) | Missing too many blocks → jailed → slashed |
| Never double-sign | One signature at the same height from two hosts is permanent jail |
| Apply chain upgrades on time | Coordinated upgrades expect all validators at the new height |
| Monitor & alert 24/7 | The chain pages **you** when it sees you, not the other way around |
| Communicate with delegators | Commission changes, identity, governance positions |

## Minimum viable validator (MVV)

The **smallest** stack the foundation considers production-ready on mainnet:

1. One validator host, dedicated to `safrochaind`, behind a firewall.
2. Two **public sentries** in front of the validator (P2P-only entry points).
3. **Remote signing** via TMKMS or Horcrux 2-of-3 — the validator host
   never holds the consensus key on disk in plaintext.
4. **Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager** scraping the validator and
   sentries; one paging integration (Discord/PagerDuty/Telegram).
5. **Encrypted off-host backups** of operator key, consensus state, and
   genesis/upgrade plans.
6. **Two operators** with documented runbooks who can both unjail at 3 a.m.

Anything smaller is a learning lab. Anything larger is a refinement of the
same six pillars.

## Status of the network

| Network | Chain ID | Status | Validator slots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet | `safro-mainnet-1` | upcoming (Q3 2026) | confirmed in genesis |
| Testnet | `safro-testnet-1` | live | open, faucet-funded |

Always validate on testnet first. Every page in this section assumes you
have a synced node — see [Run a node](../run-a-node/overview) if you do not
have one yet.
